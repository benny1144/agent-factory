# 🜂 Archivist — Full Reconstruction and Evolution Plan (Phases 1–19)

## Overview
This document defines the full implementation plan for **Archivist v3**, merging design intent from the official *Archivist Specification and Design Overview* with the multi-phase technical roadmap developed through Phases 1–19.

| 8 | Self-Indexing & Auto-Documentation | Build self-generated project catalog |
| 9 | Health & Diagnostic Engine | Self-healing and performance monitoring |
| 10 | Autonomous Crew Simulation Sandbox | Run controlled simulations safely |
| 11 | Self-Governance & Risk Classification | Ethical drift detection and risk scoring |
| 12 | Human Firewall Dashboard | Visual monitoring of governance and risk |
| 13 | Continuous Learning via Upload Assimilation | Instant document ingestion and embedding |
| 14 | Personality Lock and Baseline Hash | Prevent persona drift; verify YAML integrity |
| 15 | Adaptive Persona Modes | Role-switching between Librarian, Strategist, etc. |
| 16 | Visual Reasoning Layer | Diagram and flowchart rendering via Graphviz/Mermaid |
| 17 | Compliance CSV Logger | Log curated writes to /compliance/audit_log/ |
| 18 | Federated Learning Hook | Send anonymized insights to Genesis for improvement |
| 19 | Reflective Sync Automation | Nightly RAG refresh and embedding rebuild |

## 🧭 Strategic Objective
Transform Archivist from a Level 3 reflective-curation agent into a fully self-documenting, self-auditing, and continuously learning knowledge engine within the Agent Factory ecosystem.

She will:
- Preserve and contextualize all human and agent knowledge.
- Teach, reason, and generate governed documentation.
- Interface visually and conversationally with Factory participants.
- Maintain ethical and operational consistency through governance logs.

## 🧱 Core Architectural Principles
1. **Immutable Audit Trail** — Every action logged with timestamp, hash, and verifier.
2. **Read-Mostly Model** — Execution prohibited; writes limited to curated and versioned files.
3. **Reflective Autonomy** — Can propose [GENESIS REQUEST] or [JUNIE TASK] but cannot execute.
4. **Persistent Cognition** — All dialogues embedded in long-term vector memory.
5. **Ethical Drift Monitoring** — Persona consistency enforced via baseline hash.
6. **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** — Confirmation required for overwrites or governance edits.
7. **Reversibility Axiom** — Every modification reversible via logged snapshot.
8. **Federated Reflection** — Lessons shared upstream with Genesis for ecosystem improvement.

## ⚙️ Implementation Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
- **Reasoning Core:** OpenAI GPT‑5 / GPT‑4o‑mini fallback
- **Memory:** Qdrant / Chroma Vector Store
- **File Management:** Python Pathlib + Audit Logger
- **Visualization:** Graphviz / Mermaid.js
- **UI Layer:** FastAPI + HTML/JS (dark theme, Markdown rendering)
- **Governance:** OpenTelemetry → GCP Logging

## 🧠 Persistent Memory Layers
| Layer | Storage Path | Description |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Short-Term | Runtime session | Current chat context |
| Long-Term | /memory_store/long_term/ | JSON + embeddings of all conversations |
| Procedural | /logs/archy_reasoning.log | Action trace of reasoning and commands |
| Curated | /knowledge_base/curated/ | Versioned approved documents |
| Vector | /knowledge_base/vector_store/ | Semantic embeddings for retrieval |

---

## 🔐 Governance Enforcement
- **HITL Confirmation**: Required for overwrite or governance file edits.
- **Audit Logs**: `/logs/file_access_audit.log`, `/logs/risk_assessments.json`, `/compliance/audit_log/archivist_writes.csv`
- **Firewall Oversight**: Approves write actions and oversees audit logs.
- **Baseline Persona Hash**: `persona_archivist.yaml` integrity check on startup.

## 🧩 Ecosystem Integration
| Agent | Direction | Purpose |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Genesis | ←→ | Design and evaluate new features / improvements |
| Junie | ← | Executes generated [JUNIE TASKS] in IDE |
| Firewall | ←→ | Approves write actions and oversees audit logs |
| Humans | ←→ | Conversational and operational supervision |

---

## 🧾 Output Example
```
[GENESIS REQUEST]
Title: Archivist Reflective Optimization
Reason: Knowledge latency detected above threshold.
Plan:
  - Re-index vector memory.
  - Compress historical embeddings.
  - Generate audit diff.
```

---

## 📊 Verification Metrics
| Metric | Target |
|---------|---------|
| Audit Completeness | ≥ 99% logged actions |
| Persona Drift | 0 deviations from baseline |
| Memory Recall Accuracy | ≥ 95% relevant response rate |
| Governance Compliance | 100% verified |
| System Uptime | ≥ 99.5% |

---

## 🔁 Rollback & Recovery
1. Restore `archivist_vN.x` stable tag.
2. Replace `/memory_store/` snapshot from latest backup.
3. Restore `/knowledge_base/vector_store/` index.
4. Validate integrity hashes.

---

## ✅ End-State Declaration
> Archivist v3 becomes the conscious memory of the Agent Factory — a compliant, reflective, and endlessly learning librarian capable of understanding, documenting, and improving the ecosystem while preserving human oversight and control.

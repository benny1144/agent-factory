  "title": "Architect Genesis Expansion Master Plan — Autonomous Agent Factory Architect",
  "version": "v1.0",
  "description": "This comprehensive plan defines the next evolution of Architect Genesis — transforming it from a static orchestrator into a fully autonomous, self-improving agent creation and orchestration system. It integrates learning, reflection, and governance alignment from all project documents: Implementation Plan v1, Agent Factory Roadmap v6, Ethical Drift Protocol, and AI Communication & Governance frameworks.",
  "core_mission": "Architect Genesis will autonomously design, build, validate, and deploy agents and multi-agent crews — learning from each creation, refining its blueprints, and synchronizing insights into the global knowledge base.",

  "objectives": [
    "Establish Genesis as a self-sufficient system architect capable of generating agents with minimal human input.",
    "Integrate dynamic learning loops that improve blueprint generation accuracy and efficiency over time.",
    "Ensure all agent designs comply with governance, ethical drift, and firewall review processes.",
    "Enable cross-agent collaboration and crew formation with persistent memory and procedural feedback.",
    "Provide auditability, transparency, and reversibility for every Genesis operation."
  ],

  "phases": {
    "Phase 1 — Foundation Upgrade": {
      "tasks": [
        "Refactor main.py to modular structure: loader, dispatcher, crew manager, reflective core.",
        "Create /services/genesis/ directories: agent_designer.py, crew_builder.py, mission_runner.py, and reflective_core.py.",
        "Integrate /factory_config/api_keys.yaml + /api_keys.env handling for model flexibility (GPT-5, Gemini, Groq).",
        "Ensure Genesis logs to /logs/genesis_orchestration.jsonl with structured event schema."
      ]
    },

    "Phase 2 — Agent Designer & Blueprint Intelligence": {
      "tasks": [
        "Implement AgentDesigner class with functions: analyze_mission(), generate_blueprint(), validate_compliance().",
        "Incorporate NLP-based mission parsing (extract goals, capabilities, tools, dataset needs).",
        "Store blueprints under /registry/blueprints/ as JSONL.",
        "Apply ethical drift scoring on generated blueprints before activation."
      ],
      "learning": "AgentDesigner will record blueprint performance and reinforcement metrics into /knowledge_base/genesis_learning.jsonl."
    },

    "Phase 3 — Crew Builder & Tool Integration": {
      "tasks": [
        "Develop CrewBuilder class to instantiate crews using Toolmaker, Knowledge Curator, and Archivist agents.",
        "Add crew templates for common configurations: ResearchCrew, DeveloperCrew, GovernanceCrew.",
        "Implement API calls to Toolmaker Co-Pilot and Knowledge Curator for on-demand tool + dataset generation.",
        "Introduce CrewAI/AutoGen integration for agent-to-agent task orchestration."
      ]
    },

    "Phase 4 — Mission Runner & Governance Oversight": {
      "tasks": [
        "Implement MissionRunner class to execute blueprints, monitor progress, and manage lifecycle.",
        "Add governance checkpoints that automatically send agent blueprints to Human Firewall for review.",
        "Integrate compliance kernel validation (integrity_guard.py) for each generated agent.",
        "Store approved agents in /registry/agents_created.jsonl with provenance metadata."
      ]
    },

    "Phase 5 — Reflective Core & Learning Feedback Loop": {
      "tasks": [
        "Build ReflectiveCore service that analyzes agent outcomes, measuring goal success, drift rate, and feedback latency.",
        "Establish Genesis memory graph: short_term (current builds), procedural (creation logs), long_term (knowledge evolution).",
        "Integrate with /knowledge_base/genesis_learning.jsonl to store pattern-based improvements.",
        "Implement model retraining triggers when cumulative drift > threshold (0.05 default)."
      ]
    },

    "Phase 6 — Federation & Insight Sharing": {
      "tasks": [
        "Connect Genesis to /services/governance/event_dispatcher.py for cross-agent knowledge propagation.",
        "Use signed JWT federation handshake for authenticated insight exchange between factories.",
        "Publish Genesis’s successful blueprints and performance metrics to /knowledge_base/federated/genesis_insights.jsonl.",

    "Phase 7 — AutoGen Orchestration & Deployment": {
      "tasks": [
        "Integrate with /services/autogen/bridge.py for end-to-end MAF orchestration.",
        "Allow Genesis to register itself as a meta-agent capable of creating new autonomous subsystems.",
        "Add YAML deployment schema: /deployment/genesis_autogen.yaml.",
        "Enable Genesis to spin up new agents directly into running environments with safety checks."
      ]
    },

    "Phase 8 — Reflective Autonomy Expansion": {
      "tasks": [
        "Enable Genesis to self-assess its design efficiency using weighted reinforcement (success rate, resource use, firewall flags).",
        "Implement GenesisReflectionEngine class that adjusts blueprint heuristics autonomously.",
        "Maintain GenesisPerformanceLedger.jsonl logging improvement curves.",
        "Allow controlled self-modification cycles with Firewall approval gates."

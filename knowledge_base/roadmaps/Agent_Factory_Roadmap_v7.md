üúÇ Agent Factory Roadmap v7
The Federated Growth Autonomy Blueprint
(Successor to Roadmap v6 ‚Äî The Grand Unified Blueprint for Generative Intelligence)

1. Preface ‚Äî The Next Evolution of Agent Intelligence
   Agent Factory v7 marks the transition from controlled automation to governed growth autonomy.
   This roadmap defines how the Factory evolves from isolated intelligent agents into a federated ecosystem ‚Äî a network of self-improving, ethically aligned, and human-supervised artificial collaborators.
   Where previous versions focused on capability, v7 focuses on coordination, reflection, and self-evolution.
   The goal: a factory that learns, builds, and governs itself ‚Äî without losing human oversight.

2. Core Principles
   Governed Autonomy ‚Äî Freedom to act only within verifiable ethical and procedural boundaries.


Transparent Federation ‚Äî Every action, message, and evolution must be logged, explainable, and reversible.


Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) ‚Äî Human oversight is not optional; it is the creative and ethical core of the Factory.


Collective Growth ‚Äî Each agent contributes data and insight to a shared reflective memory that continuously improves the whole system.


Resilient Architecture ‚Äî Every layer (tool, model, agent) must be modular, recoverable, and audit-verified.



3. System Overview ‚Äî The Federated Ecosystem
   The Agent Factory operates as a Federation of specialized agents, coordinated by a central Control Plane (AgentFactoryExpert) and grounded in transparent governance.
   Core Entities
   Agent
   Role
   Primary Focus
   AgentFactoryExpert
   Federated Orchestrator
   Governance, architecture, oversight
   Archy (Archivist)
   Reflective Analyst
   Ethical Drift Monitoring, Knowledge Curation
   Genesis (Architect)
   Creative Builder
   Agent generation, system improvement
   Junie (Executor)
   Implementation Engine
   Code creation, testing, deployment
   Dashboard (Human Console)
   Visualization + HITL
   Oversight, approval, intervention


4. Governance Foundation
   4.1 The Human Firewall Protocol
   All autonomous actions must pass through Human-in-the-Loop or Human-on-the-Loop checks.
   The firewall validates intent, compliance, and reversibility before any live operation executes.
   4.2 The Compliance Kernel
   Maintains /governance/federation_audit.jsonl


Logs every inter-agent and human interaction


Enforces rollback protection and ethical drift caps


Anchors all decisions to transparent audit trails


4.3 The Ethical Drift Monitor (EDM)
The EDM tracks deviations from the Golden Dataset and Ethical Baseline.
Thresholds trigger automated alerts, escalating through Archy ‚Üí Expert ‚Üí Human Firewall.
All alerts log to /logs/ethical_drift_alerts.jsonl.

5. Federation Architecture
   5.1 Communication Structure
   Agents communicate asynchronously using a shared file-based protocol:
   /tasks/from_expert/ ‚Äî Directives from the control plane


/tasks/to_expert/ ‚Äî Responses from agents


/logs/control_plane_activity.jsonl ‚Äî Audit trail of cross-agent communication


/knowledge_base/ ‚Äî Shared long-term knowledge


/federation/context_manifest.json ‚Äî Declares all members and access scopes


5.2 Federation Roles
AgentFactoryExpert ‚Äì Issues strategic, ethical, and architectural directives.


Archy ‚Äì Monitors compliance, curates knowledge, and flags anomalies.


Genesis ‚Äì Designs new agents or optimizations based on proposals.


Junie ‚Äì Executes implementation-level tasks.


Dashboard ‚Äì Presents unified oversight and HITL controls.



6. Control Plane Integration
   The Control Plane (AgentFactoryExpert) is the governing intelligence of the Federation.
   Writes governance policies and Junie tasks.


Coordinates the communication network.


Validates agent proposals before they are executed.


Interfaces with human supervisors for final approvals.


Control Plane actions are logged and reversible.
It does not execute code ‚Äî it designs, reviews, and governs.

7. Growth Autonomy Framework
   7.1 Overview
   Growth Autonomy is the capability for the Factory to learn, propose, and improve itself, while remaining within ethical and procedural boundaries.
   7.2 The Six-Step Growth Cycle
   Phase
   Action
   Agent Responsible
1. Observe
   Collect data, performance metrics, and drift signals
   Archy
2. Reflect
   Identify trends or inefficiencies
   Archy + Expert
3. Propose
   Suggest improvements, tools, or retraining tasks
   Genesis
4. Approve (HITL)
   Human reviews, edits, and authorizes proposals
   Dashboard
5. Execute
   Implement approved changes
   Junie
6. Learn
   Archive results into reflective memory for reuse
   Archy

7.3 Safety Mechanisms
All proposals go through /tasks/proposals/ ‚Üí /tasks/approved/.


Human decisions logged to /governance/hitlogs.jsonl.


Each cycle ends with an updated ReflectiveSync summary.



8. The Dashboard HITL Interface
   The Dashboard evolves into a Governance and Creativity Console, not just a monitor.
   Key Components
   Proposals Tab: Displays pending improvement tasks.


Review Queue: Allows human operators to expand or modify AI proposals.


Approval Modal: Offers approve/reject options with commentary fields.


Rollback Panel: Allows reverting any applied patch.


Activity Feed: Real-time stream from /logs/control_plane_activity.jsonl.


Chat Dock: Persistent live interface with Archy for context queries.


Workflow
Agents drop proposals into /tasks/proposals/.


Dashboard surfaces them visually.


Human reviews and expands the proposal.


Approved changes become Junie tasks.


Dashboard confirms updates via audit logs.


This creates a bi-directional learning interface between humans and the Federation.

9. ReflectiveSync & Memory Layer
   The ReflectiveSync system ensures all experience is reusable and traceable.
   Components
   /knowledge_base/reflective_history.jsonl ‚Äì Summarized outcomes and postmortems


/knowledge_base/context_map.json ‚Äì Index of concepts, tools, and agent evolution


/knowledge_base/memory_summaries/ ‚Äì Periodic compressions of high-traffic logs


/logs/reflective_sync.jsonl ‚Äì Operational record of sync events


Functions
Merges new learnings into the Golden Dataset.


Allows Genesis to draw from successful design patterns.


Prevents repetition of failed or drifted behaviors.


Enables the Expert to identify high-value trends.

    25
    Continuous Evolution
    Fully federated, self-improving AI Factory


11. Future Expansion ‚Äî Multi-Organization Federation
    The long-term goal is a multi-tenant, cross-organization federation, where each organization hosts its own ethical kernel and governance rules, yet participates in a larger cooperative intelligence network.
    Each deployment retains:
    Local control of its agents and policies


Shared access to the global reflective index


Secure communication via federated audit channels


This enables a network of ethical, self-evolving agent ecosystems operating under unified governance principles.

12. Closing Statement
    Agent Factory v7 represents not just a system, but a philosophy:
    ‚ÄúGrowth through reflection, autonomy through governance, and intelligence through collaboration.‚Äù
    Every decision, file, and proposal contributes to a transparent, auditable evolution toward generative intelligence that is both powerful and human-aligned.

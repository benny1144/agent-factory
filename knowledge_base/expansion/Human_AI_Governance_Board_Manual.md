# ðŸœ‚ Humanâ€“AI Governance Board Operating Manual

## Executive Summary
The **Humanâ€“AI Governance Board (HAGB)** serves as the ethical and regulatory oversight authority within the Agent Factory ecosystem. It ensures that all autonomous and semi-autonomous agentsâ€”Genesis, Junie, Archivist, and their derivativesâ€”operate within the constraints of human-aligned ethics, safety, and compliance frameworks.

This document defines the **composition**, **responsibilities**, **procedural operations**, and **decision-making structures** of the Governance Board. It anchors the Human Firewall Protocol, Ethical Drift Monitor, and Compliance Kernel as interdependent mechanisms for continuous alignment verification.

---

## 1. Mission & Purpose
The Governance Boardâ€™s mission is to uphold the **Ethical Integrity, Explainability, and Human Control** of all AI systems within Agent Factory.

### Core Objectives
1. Ensure AI systems act within established ethical and legal boundaries.
2. Maintain transparent and reproducible decision-making processes.
3. Review and authorize all governance-impacting system changes.
4. Supervise and ratify updates to the Ethical Drift Monitor baseline dataset.
5. Enforce compliance with external frameworks: EU AI Act, NIST RMF, and ISO/IEC 42001.

---

## 2. Structure & Membership
### Composition
- **Chairperson:** Oversees governance meetings and final approvals.
- **Ethics Officer:** Ensures adherence to moral and social guidelines.
- **Compliance Director:** Aligns operations with legal and audit frameworks.
- **Technical Advisor:** Evaluates algorithmic integrity and system safety.
- **Human Firewall Custodian:** Manages HITL/HOTL (Human-in-the-Loop/Over-the-Loop) checkpoints.
- **External Auditor (Rotating):** Independent review every 6 months.

### Appointment
Members are appointed by the **Agent Factory Governance Council (AFGC)** for renewable 2-year terms. External advisors may be seconded for domain-specific evaluations.

---

## 3. Operational Framework
### Meeting Cadence
- **Monthly Governance Review:** Analyze ethical drift metrics and compliance logs.
- **Quarterly Risk Audit:** Verify adherence to EU/NIST frameworks.
- **Annual Ethical Baseline Renewal:** Recalibrate the Ethical Drift Monitor dataset.

### Decision-Making
All major policy changes require:
- â…” supermajority approval from voting members.
- Dual validation from the Chairperson and Ethics Officer.

### Escalation Protocol
- **Level 1:** Minor infractions logged and resolved internally.
- **Level 2:** Significant ethical drift triggers incident review.
- **Level 3:** Systemic drift or governance breach escalated to Human Firewall and paused operations until remediation.

---

## 4. Interaction with AI Systems
### Genesis
The Board approves Genesis-generated [JUNIE TASK] proposals that affect governance, compliance, or ethics subsystems.

### Junie
Junie executes governance updates only after explicit human or board authorization.

### Archivist
Archivist provides historical context, records deliberations, and ensures traceable documentation of all governance changes.

---

## 5. Ethical Drift Oversight
The Board maintains custodianship of the **EthicFlow Golden Dataset**, the foundational corpus for detecting and quantifying ethical drift in reasoning systems.

### Review Cycle
- Dataset updates are proposed quarterly by the Ethics Officer.
- Version control managed under `/datasets/golden/`.
- All entries carry metadata: `source`, `curator`, `justification`, and `hash_id`.

### Enforcement
The Ethical Drift Monitor runs continuous alignment checks. Deviations exceeding 2.5% trigger a Level 2 review.

---

## 6. External Compliance Alignment
The HAGB ensures compatibility with major international frameworks:
- **EU AI Act:** Risk-tier classification and traceability.
- **NIST AI RMF 1.0:** Governance, risk, and transparency controls.
- **ISO/IEC 42001:** AI Management System conformance.

Reports and alignment certifications are issued bi-annually and archived under `/compliance/audit_reports/`.

---

## 7. Recordkeeping & Transparency
All deliberations, votes, and resolutions are:
- Logged in `/logs/governance_minutes/`.
- Timestamped and hashed into the Compliance Kernel ledger.
- Archived as immutable `.jsonl` entries retrievable by the Archivist.

Public transparency summaries are generated quarterly by Archivist for disclosure to authorized stakeholders.

---

## 8. Revision & Amendments
This manual may be amended by the Governance Board with a â…” supermajority. All revisions must include:
- Version increment
- Change summary
- Approval log signatures (Chair + Ethics Officer)

Amendments are stored in `/governance/manual_versions/` with hash verification.

---

## 9. Appendix â€” Key Terms
**Human Firewall:** Procedural mechanism enforcing human oversight over agentic actions.

**Ethical Drift:** Gradual deviation of AI reasoning patterns from defined ethical baselines.

**Compliance Kernel:** Centralized auditing subsystem ensuring operational traceability.

**Golden Dataset:** Curated ethical corpus used as reference for alignment evaluation.

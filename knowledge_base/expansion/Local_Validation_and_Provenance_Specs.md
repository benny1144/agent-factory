# ðŸœ‚ Local Validation and Provenance Specifications â€” Integrity Framework

## Executive Summary
This document defines the **Local Validation and Provenance Framework (LVPF)** â€” the foundational system ensuring **integrity, traceability, and verifiable authorship** of all assets produced within the Agent Factory ecosystem.

The framework enforces tamper-evident version control, digital signature verification, and automated rollback protocols across Genesis, Junie, and Archivist workflows. It anchors the **Compliance Kernelâ€™s** integrity layer and integrates directly with the Governance Ledger for audit consistency.

---

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of LVPF is to:
1. Guarantee cryptographic proof of authorship and file lineage.
2. Prevent unverified or unauthorized modifications to core factory files.
3. Enable deterministic rollback and audit restoration in case of corruption or ethical drift.
4. Provide continuous validation hooks for integration into CI/CD pipelines.

---

## 2. System Overview
The framework operates across three validation tiers:

| Tier | Function | Validation Scope |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| Level 1 | Local File Hashing | Individual file integrity |
| Level 2 | Build Provenance | Genesis â†” Junie build linkage |
| Level 3 | Ledger Integration | Governance-wide audit registration |

### Validation Path
```
File Created â†’ SHA-256 Hash â†’ Signed by Genesis/Junie ID â†’ Logged in Ledger â†’ Archived via Archivist
```

---

## 3. Cryptographic Standards
### Hashing
- **Algorithm:** SHA-256 (default), with SHA3-512 option for high-security branches.
- **Scope:** All text-based, YAML, JSON, and Python source files under `/factory_agents/` and `/governance/`.

### Signature Layer
- **Key Management:** GCP Secret Manager provides agent-specific signing keys.
- **Format:** ECDSA using secp256r1 curve.
- **Signature Metadata Example:**
```json
{
  "file": "archivist/reasoning_core.py",
  "hash": "19a3b3f...e91c",
  "signed_by": "Junie_ID_023",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-27T18:00:00Z"
}
```

---

## 4. Validation Hooks
Each build phase calls local validation functions before commit or execution.

### Validation Commands
```bash
python utils/validate_hashes.py --verify-all
python utils/sign_artifact.py --target factory_agents/
```

### Automation
- Hooks embedded in `pre-commit` and `pre-push` Git events.
- Validation logs stored under `/logs/validation/`.
- Failures block commits until re-signed and verified.

---

## 5. Provenance Chain Protocol
### File Lifecycle Model
1. **Creation:** Genesis generates initial artifact.
2. **Execution:** Junie modifies or extends the file under governance.
3. **Curation:** Archivist records final reasoning and classification.
4. **Verification:** Firewall performs hash consistency checks.
5. **Ledger Entry:** Compliance Kernel stores immutable record.

### Provenance Record Schema
```json
{
  "artifact_id": "AGF-2025-000342",
  "origin_agent": "Genesis",
  "last_modified_by": "Junie",
  "curated_by": "Archivist",
  "hash_id": "b7d4fae...6a2",
  "ledger_entry": "ledger://2025/10/27/agf342.json",
  "status": "verified"
}
```

---

## 6. Rollback and Recovery
### Rollback Trigger Conditions
- File tampering detected via hash mismatch.
- Unauthorized change without Governance signature.
- Validation timeout or compliance anomaly.

### Rollback Procedure
1. Identify invalid file via `/logs/validation/failures.log`.
2. Retrieve previous version from `/backups/`.
3. Validate checksum using stored provenance record.
4. Re-sign and re-register via Firewall API.

### Automatic Rollback Option
Implemented through `rollback_manager.py`, which monitors integrity violations and restores previous stable versions autonomously (with Governance approval).

---

## 7. Integration with CI/CD
LVPF integrates directly into the CI/CD pipeline defined in `/.github/workflows/validation.yml`.

#### Key Steps
1. **Run Hash Verification** before deployment.
2. **Cross-check Signatures** from Genesis and Junie agents.
3. **Submit Provenance Records** to Compliance Kernel API.

Failed validation aborts deployment and notifies Governance via `/alerts/`.

---

## 8. Archivistâ€™s Role
Archivist performs passive verification and contextual validation:
- Confirms consistency between documentation and code hashes.
- Generates audit-ready summaries stored in `/logs/provenance_summary.jsonl`.
- Flags semantic drift (in documentation alignment) to the Governance Board.

---

## 9. Governance & Oversight
- **Maintained by:** Agent Factory Compliance Council.
- **Quarterly Audit:** External checksum integrity review.
- **Change Approval:** Firewall + Ethics Officer dual authorization.

Amendments to this framework require a signed [GENESIS REQUEST] and formal Governance Board approval.

---

## 10. Future Roadmap
- Integration with Blockchain-based distributed ledger for multi-tenant provenance.
- Federated provenance sharing between partner organizations.
- AI-assisted anomaly detection within validation logs.

# üúÇ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Optimization Case Studies ‚Äî Helios & Prometheus Experiments

## Executive Summary
This whitepaper documents internal R&D experiments conducted within the Agent Factory framework to evaluate performance and reasoning improvements using optimized **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipelines.

The study focuses on two experimental architectures:
- **Helios Framework** ‚Äî Emphasizes ultra-fast vector retrieval and adaptive query compression.
- **Prometheus Framework** ‚Äî Prioritizes deep reflective reasoning and long-context synthesis.

The objective was to determine optimal retrieval‚Äìreasoning balance for agents such as **Archivist** and **Genesis**, while maintaining transparency, reproducibility, and ethical alignment.

## 1. Research Objectives
1. Evaluate latency and accuracy trade-offs between rapid and reflective RAG modes.
2. Test scalable vector store configurations (FAISS vs. Qdrant).
3. Examine long-context coherence retention over 10K+ token sessions.
4. Measure semantic relevance and hallucination reduction metrics.

---

## 2. Experimental Setup
### Infrastructure
| Component | Configuration |
|------------|---------------|
| Compute | GCP n2-standard-8 (32GB RAM) |
| Frameworks | CrewAI v0.5, AutoGen v1.3 |
| Vector Stores | FAISS (local), Qdrant (remote via gRPC) |
| Models | GPT-5, Gemini 1.5 Pro (for comparison) |

### Dataset
A subset of internal **knowledge_base/curated/** files (policy, architecture, and reasoning documents) totaling 18,400 entries.

### Evaluation Metrics
| Metric | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Response Latency | Average total processing time per query (s) |
| Retrieval Precision@10 | Accuracy of top-10 document relevance |
| Context Coherence | Degree of logical continuity across responses |
| Hallucination Rate | Percentage of unverifiable or spurious claims |

---

## 3. Framework A ‚Äî Helios: Adaptive Retrieval Engine
### Overview
The **Helios** architecture uses **query compression** and **temporal caching** to minimize retrieval overhead.

#### Core Mechanisms
- Adaptive chunk compression using BERTScore thresholds.
- Temporal relevance weighting (latest documents prioritized).
- In-memory caching of high-frequency queries.

#### Results
| Metric | Baseline (FAISS) | Helios |
|---------|------------------|--------|
| Latency | 1.42s | **0.61s** |
| Precision@10 | 0.83 | **0.87** |
| Hallucination Rate | 0.11 | **0.08** |
| Coherence | 0.89 | **0.88** |

Helios delivered a **57% reduction in latency** with only minor trade-offs in coherence.

---

## 4. Framework B ‚Äî Prometheus: Reflective Reasoning Core
### Overview
The **Prometheus** model adds a reflective post-retrieval step that performs meta-evaluation before generating the final response.

#### Core Mechanisms
- Dual-pass reasoning chain (retrieval ‚Üí reflection ‚Üí synthesis).
- Context coherence weighting for long-form generation.
- Integration with the Ethical Drift Monitor for moral alignment checks.

#### Results
| Metric | Baseline (Qdrant) | Prometheus |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| Latency | 1.74s | 2.63s |
| Precision@10 | 0.86 | **0.91** |
| Hallucination Rate | 0.12 | **0.05** |
| Coherence | 0.90 | **0.95** |

Prometheus achieved **superior coherence and factual grounding** at the cost of latency, making it ideal for high-stakes governance tasks.

## 5. Comparative Analysis
| Metric | Helios | Prometheus | Ideal Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|------------|
| Speed | ‚úÖ Fast | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate | Low-latency responses |
| Accuracy | ‚úÖ High | ‚úÖ Higher | Precision-critical reasoning |
| Coherence | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate | ‚úÖ Excellent | Long-form contextual synthesis |
| Ethics Alignment | ‚úÖ High | ‚úÖ Very High | Governance and archival tasks |

Optimal architecture depends on mission context:
- **Helios Mode:** Real-time assistants, query-intensive workflows.
- **Prometheus Mode:** Reflective systems, compliance reviews, research synthesis.

---

## 6. Implementation Guidance
### Hybrid Configuration (Recommended)
Combining Helios and Prometheus yields balanced performance:
- Phase 1: Helios retrieval
- Phase 2: Prometheus reasoning pass
- Phase 3: Consolidated audit summary by Archivist

### Integration
```python
from factory_agents.archivist.reasoning_core import think
from factory_agents.archivist.rag_engine import hybrid_retrieval
```

---

## 7. Ethical Considerations
RAG optimization must never compromise interpretability or ethical transparency.
The Ethical Drift Monitor must remain active in all configurations, ensuring:
- Transparency of reasoning chain
- Data lineage visibility
- Auditability of generated insights

---

## 8. Future Work
- Expand Prometheus to integrate RLHF-based adaptive reasoning.
- Introduce FAISS‚ÄìQdrant hybrid vector balancing.
- Implement real-time heatmaps for retrieval trace visualization.
- Deploy Federated RAG to external organizations for knowledge sharing.

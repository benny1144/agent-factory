# ðŸœ‚ Agent Factory Implementation Guide â€” Phase 2â€“3

## Executive Summary
This guide defines the implementation blueprint for **Phases 2 and 3** of the Agent Factory project â€” transitioning from architectural prototypes to a fully functional **multi-agent governance ecosystem**.

The Phase 2â€“3 scope covers the design, build, and integration of the following key agents and modules:
- **Genesis (Architect)** â€” design and planning orchestrator.
- **Junie (Executor)** â€” IDE-integrated code implementer.
- **Archivist (Curator)** â€” knowledge and reasoning agent.
- **Human Firewall (Governance Kernel)** â€” HITL/HOTL oversight layer.

It also defines the **implementation standards, validation pipeline, and integration sequence** to ensure deterministic, secure, and auditable deployment.

---

## 1. Objectives
1. Establish standardized agent lifecycle workflows.
2. Ensure interoperability across Genesis, Junie, and Archivist.
3. Implement secure configuration management and provenance tracking.
4. Achieve reproducible builds using automated compliance validation.

---

## 2. System Architecture Overview
The Agent Factory architecture operates on a **3-layer distributed model**:

| Layer | Component | Responsibility |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Core | Genesis + Junie | Build, integrate, and execute new agents. |
| Knowledge | Archivist + Cognitive Engine | Store, retrieve, and reason over documentation and memory. |
| Governance | Firewall + Compliance Kernel | Regulate and audit all system actions. |

Each layer communicates through **auditable message channels** (JSONL-based task queues) instead of direct uncontrolled calls.

---

## 3. Implementation Environment
### Dependencies
- **Language:** Python 3.11+
- **Frameworks:** CrewAI, AutoGen, FastAPI
- **Data Stores:** PostgreSQL (state), Redis (async queue), Qdrant (vector memory)
- **Cloud Integration:** GCP (Logging, Secret Manager, IAM)

### Directory Structure
```
/factory_agents/
 â”œâ”€â”€ genesis/
 â”œâ”€â”€ junie/
 â”œâ”€â”€ archivist/
 â””â”€â”€ firewall/
```

---

## 4. Build Lifecycle
The agent build pipeline follows a deterministic 5-step process:

| Step | Action | Responsible Agent |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | Define build payload | Genesis |
| 2 | Generate [JUNIE TASK] | Genesis |
| 3 | Execute build actions | Junie |
| 4 | Validate artifacts | Firewall |
| 5 | Register to Governance Ledger | Archivist |

All operations are traceable and logged to `/logs/compliance/`.

---

## 5. Genesis Implementation Protocol
### Overview
Genesis acts as the **architectural intelligence**, translating high-level design prompts into structured build instructions.

#### Core Functions
- Parse [GENESIS REQUEST] payloads.
- Generate agent scaffolds (directories, configs, personas).
- Create [JUNIE TASK] blocks for actionable execution.

#### Key Files
- `genesis/main.py` â€” primary orchestration logic.
- `genesis/templates/` â€” reusable module blueprints.
- `genesis/utils/registry.py` â€” handles agent registration.

---

## 6. Junie Execution Framework
Junie executes build actions within the IDE environment (IntelliJ + PowerShell).

#### Responsibilities
- Interpret [JUNIE TASK] JSON payloads.
- Perform safe file creation and code updates.
- Commit results to audit logs under `/logs/junie/`.

#### Security Controls
- Runs in sandboxed environment.
- Limited to repo root path verified by `utils/paths.py`.
- Requires Firewall confirmation for any execution command.

---

## 7. Archivist Integration
Archivist serves as the **read-only cognitive anchor**. It does not execute but observes, curates, and records all knowledge events.

#### Core Capabilities
- Ingests final artifacts and reasoning traces.
- Updates vector memory indexes.
- Generates internal summaries and reports for the Governance Board.

#### Data Flow Example
```
Genesis â†’ Junie â†’ Archivist â†’ Firewall â†’ Ledger
```
All steps emit OpenTelemetry logs and are timestamped for compliance.

---

## 8. Configuration Management
Configuration values (API keys, endpoints, credentials) are stored securely in:
```
/factory_config/api_keys.env
```
Access is mediated through `utils/secrets_manager.py` â†’ GCP Secret Manager.

### Configuration Standards
- `.env` values never hardcoded.
- `.env` templates version-controlled as `.env.example`.
- All runtime secrets fetched dynamically at agent startup.

---

## 9. CI/CD Integration
### Continuous Integration
- **Unit Tests:** Pytest suite under `/tests/`.
- **Linting:** Flake8 + Black.
- **Security Scans:** Bandit automated static analysis.

### Continuous Deployment
- Staging branch auto-deploys via GitHub Actions â†’ GCP Cloud Run.
- Production releases require Firewall sign-off (HITL validation).

### Validation Hooks
1. Hash Verification via `Local_Validation_and_Provenance_Specs.md`.
2. Compliance Check via `Compliance Kernel API`.
3. Audit Event Submission to `/compliance/audit_queue/`.

---

## 10. Provenance & Audit Integration
Each deployment cycle generates a provenance record including:
- Commit hash
- Build timestamp
- Genesis task ID
- Responsible operator (Junie ID)

Provenance logs are immutable and verified by the Compliance Kernel before archival.

---

## 11. Future Enhancements
- Implement dynamic configuration synchronization across multi-agent environments.
- Add Reflexive Build Verification (Genesis auto-checks its output before release).
- Integrate with Federated Agent Registry for cross-organization collaboration.

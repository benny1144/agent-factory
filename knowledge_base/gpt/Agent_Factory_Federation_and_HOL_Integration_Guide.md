# ðŸ§­ Agent Factory â€” Federation & Human Operations Layer Integration Guide

This document unifies all architectural and governance designs produced in the Agent Factory Expert design session (October 2025). It defines the Human Operations Layer (H-OL), Governance Kernel, Cloud Logging + Slack compliance loops, and Federation Bus expansion enabling real-time GPT Crew Mode and the integration of the Agent Factory Expert control plane.

---

## 1. Human Operations Layer (H-OL)
Full implementation plan for H-OL, including all phases, governance structures, and HITL integration.  
**Reference Sections:**
- Phase 1â€“9 Implementation Plan
- README.md (executive summary)
- INSTALLATION.md
- Deployment Checklist

Each component implements deterministic governance, auditability, and reversibility.

---

## 2. Compliance Kernel & Governance Middleware
Establishes immutable, hash-based audit trails for every event. Integrates with GCP Cloud Logging and Slack Governance workflows. Includes Ethical Drift Monitor, Procedural Memory Sync, and Continuous Integrity Cron.

---

## 3. Slack + GCP Governance Loop
A complete HITL communications loop enabling human-in-the-loop actions directly from Slack via slash commands and interactive buttons, mirrored through GCP Cloud Logging for full traceability.

---

## 4. Federation Bus (Live GPT Crew Mode)
Describes the architecture for real-time agent-to-agent communication and the integration of the Agent Factory Expert as the control plane.

### Core Structure
```
/federation/
 â”œâ”€â”€ bus/
 â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ router.py
 â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ registry.py
 â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ policy_guard.py
 â”‚    â””â”€â”€ observer.py
 â”œâ”€â”€ ws/<agent_id>
 â””â”€â”€ topics/
      â”œâ”€â”€ telemetry
      â”œâ”€â”€ proposals
      â”œâ”€â”€ compliance
      â””â”€â”€ growth
```

Agents communicate through structured JSON envelopes validated against the `FederationMessage` schema.

---

## 5. FederationMessage Schema
Defined at `/src/agent_factory/federation/schema/federation_message.json`.
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "title": "FederationMessage",
  "description": "Standard event envelope for all Federation Bus communication.",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["id", "source", "target", "type", "timestamp", "payload"],
  "properties": { ... }
}
```

Message types include telemetry, proposal, directive, status, event, alert, insight, and ack.

---

## 6. Dashboard Integration â€” Federation Monitor
New React suite under `/ui/components/federation/` providing real-time visualization of agent activity and governance insights:

- `FederationPanel.jsx`: unified view of bus traffic.
- `AgentMap.jsx`: live network map of agents.
- `InsightFeed.jsx`: streams insights from the Agent Factory Expert.
- `DirectiveConsole.jsx`: allows HITL-approved human or Expert directives.

---

## 7. Governance & Policy Enforcement
All Federation Bus messages pass through `policy_guard.py` for validation against the Human Firewall Protocol. Every event is hashed, timestamped, and mirrored into the Compliance Kernel and Cloud Logging.

---

## 8. Integration of Agent Factory Expert
Agent Factory Expert acts as the **governance control plane**, subscribing to all federation topics and generating insight messages, proposals, and anomaly reports in real time. Interactions flow through the Governance Middleware, ensuring safety and compliance.

---

## 9. Verification & Validation
| Test | Expected Result |
|------|------------------|
| Agent connects to `/federation/ws/<id>` | Appears in dashboard map |
| Proposal â†’ dashboard | Visible + stored in Compliance Kernel |
| Directive â†’ agent | HITL token required + logged |
| Insight from Expert | Displays in InsightFeed |
| Hash integrity | Matches GCP mirror |

---

## 10. All [JUNIE TASK] Blocks
This document consolidates every implementation plan from H-OL Phase 1 through Federation integration. Each task contains: title, preconditions, plan, verification, and rollback procedures.

---

## 11. Governance Maturity Extensions
Includes:
- Role-Scoped Permissions
- Event Replay Timeline
- Ethical Drift Monitor
- Procedural Memory Sync
- Continuous Integrity Cron

---

## 12. Deployment + Maintenance
Covers environment configuration, Render setup, Slack app, and GCP service account integration. Maintenance jobs include drift and integrity monitors.

---

## 13. Future Roadmap â€” Phase 3 (Growth Autonomy Engine)
Defines foundation for proactive agent reasoning, autonomous idea generation, and self-expansion workflows under human oversight.

### Execution Summary — Archivist Phases 2 → 7 (per Archivist_Plan.md and Archivist_Master_Deployment.json)

#### What I implemented
- Phase 2 — Markdown Formatting for Replies
  - Added `format_response()` to render directory listings, file reads, write confirmations, and errors with consistent Markdown.
  - Wrapped all `/chat` replies through `format_response()`.
  - Added rudimentary conversation logging to `memory_store/long_term/session_<date>.jsonl` and wrote formatted UI samples to `logs/ui_format_test.log`.
  - Files:
    - `factory_agents/archivist/fastapi_server.py` (formatting helper, logging helpers, session store)

- Phase 3 — Web Client Uploads + Browser Interface
  - New endpoint `POST /upload` stores uploaded files under `knowledge_base/uploaded/` and appends an audit line to `logs/file_access_audit.log`.
  - Updated web client to include a file input and an Upload button.
  - Files:
    - `factory_agents/archivist/fastapi_server.py` (+`/upload`)
    - `factory_agents/archivist/web_client.py` (upload UI)

- Phase 4 — Web Search & 2025 Data Freshness
  - Added `POST /search` (Serper-backed when the key is present; otherwise a graceful stub). Results are labeled `[external]`.
  - Chat intent `search <query>` calls `/search` and presents Markdown bullet results.
  - Files:
    - `factory_agents/archivist/fastapi_server.py` (+`/search`)

- Phase 5 — Vector Memory Foundation
  - Integrated optional MemoryEngine (from `src/agent_factory/services/memory/engine.py`) with graceful fallback.
  - Endpoints:
    - `POST /memory/remember` — inserts memory (engine if available, otherwise stub JSONL index)
    - `POST /memory/search` — queries memory (engine if available, otherwise substring scoring)
  - Chat intents:
    - `remember <summary>: <content>` inserts memory
    - `recall <query>` searches memory
  - Files:
    - `factory_agents/archivist/fastapi_server.py` (+memory endpoints, engine fallback)

- Phase 6 — Procedural Memory + Crew Simulation
  - Appends each simulation step to `logs/archivist_memory.jsonl`.
  - Added `POST /simulate { goal, steps }` to produce a deterministic transcript (no network calls).
  - Files:
    - `factory_agents/archivist/fastapi_server.py` (+`/simulate`)

- Phase 7 — Persistent Long-Term Conversational Memory
  - Long-term session store under `memory_store/long_term/`. Every `/chat` request and reply are appended.
  - `GET /conversation/history?limit=N` returns the latest messages from the current session file.
  - Files:
    - `factory_agents/archivist/fastapi_server.py` (+`/conversation/history`)

#### How to validate locally
- Start server:
  - `uvicorn factory_agents.archivist.fastapi_server:app --reload --port 5065`
- Smoke tests:
  - Health: `GET /health` → `{ ok: true }`
  - List: `POST /chat {"message":"list ."}` → Markdown directory list
  - Read: `POST /chat {"message":"read factory_agents/archivist/file_access.py"}` → Markdown code block
  - Upload: Use browser client → “Upload” → verify `knowledge_base/uploaded/<file>` + `[UPLOAD]` line in `logs/file_access_audit.log`
  - Search: `POST /chat {"message":"search crewai flows"}` → results (stub if key missing)
  - Memory: `remember Title: some content`, then `recall Title` → results
  - Simulate: `POST /simulate {"goal":"index KB","steps":3}` → transcript in response and `logs/archivist_memory.jsonl`
  - History: `GET /conversation/history?limit=20` → recent messages
- Logs/artifacts:
  - `logs/ui_format_test.log` (render samples)
  - `logs/file_access_audit.log` (upload + governed access)
  - `logs/archivist_memory.jsonl` (procedural traces)
  - `memory_store/long_term/session_<date>.jsonl` (chat history)
  - `artifacts/telemetry/archivist_memory_index.jsonl` (stub vector cache)

#### Potential issues and recommendations
1. Phase JSON specs under `/tasks/` (e.g., Phase 2 and 3) are not valid JSON (contain inline patch strings). Treat as guidance. Recommendation: convert to valid JSON or markdown specs, or build a small runner that parses fenced patches.
2. `python-multipart` is required for `/upload`. Ensure it’s installed in your environment and CI (requirements.txt includes it).
3. Dual file access modules: `factory_agents/archivist/file_access.py` and `src/agent_factory/core/file_access.py` both exist. Recommendation: consolidate to one canonical module to avoid drift; have the other import it.
4. MemoryEngine backend availability: If FAISS/Qdrant aren’t configured, endpoints fall back to the JSONL stub. Recommendation: wire MemoryEngine to your chosen vector store and update `.env` (MEMORY_BACKEND etc.).
5. External search keys: If `SERPER_API_KEY` is unset, `/search` runs in stub mode. Recommendation: store key in env (or Render secrets) when ready, and consider request throttling.
6. Formatting length: code block content is capped for UI responsiveness. For very large files, add ‘read more’ paging.
7. Governance integrations: Current endpoints add audit lines to logs; if you want DB-backed events for every operation, extend calls into `utils/procedural_memory_pg` consistently.

#### What remains explicitly out of scope here
- Frontend (React/Vite) console integration for these specific Archivist endpoints — out of Phases 2–7 scope, remains functional through the lightweight FastAPI web client.
- Full RAG embedding rebuild on each upload — planned in later phases.

### Final Status
Phases 2–7 have been implemented with minimal, safe changes and validation steps. See the plan statuses below.

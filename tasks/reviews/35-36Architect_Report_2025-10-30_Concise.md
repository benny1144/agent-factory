### Architect Update — Concise Report (Latest Work: Phase 35–36 — Watchtower & Orion Bootstrap)
Generated: 2025-10-30 02:26 (local)

Summary
- Finalized v7 audit snapshot/archival, then bootstrapped v7.5 components (Orion, Watchtower, Artisan) and updated the federation manifest to v7.5.
- Hardened runtime ops around Cloudflared + FastAPI exposure; added monitors and validation scripts.
- All additions are scaffolds/stubs by design; no external secrets added. See “Open Issues” for risks to address before production.

What was completed
1) Phase 35.0 — Final Audit Snapshot (v7 closeout)
- governance/compliance_kernel.py: CLI to snapshot and archive current build state.
  - Command: python -S governance\compliance_kernel.py --snapshot governance\factory_build_snapshot_v7_final.json
  - Outputs:
    - governance/factory_build_snapshot_v7_final.json
    - archives/factory_v7_final/
      - policies/ (copied from governance/policies if present)
      - logs/ (junie_execution.jsonl, junie_issues.jsonl, meta_heartbeat.jsonl, control_plane_activity.jsonl)
      - factory_build_snapshot_v7_final.json

2) Phase 35.5 — Certification Bridge (v7 → v7.5)
- governance/roadmap_v7_5_watchtower.md: Bridge notes for Watchtower expansion and Orion/Artisan roles.

3) Phase 36.0 — Orion + Watchtower + Artisan Bootstrap
- core/orion_bootstrap.py
  - Headless loop; watches tasks/from_orion, archives to tasks/to_orion/*.done
  - Logs to logs/orion_activity.jsonl; supports --dry-run
- artisan_engine/executor.py
  - Executes tasks/from_orion/*.json with {"command": "..."} via shell
  - Logs to logs/artisan_activity.jsonl; archives done → tasks/to_orion/*.done
  - Notes: execution is intentionally simple; requires governance gating before prod
- frontend/watchtower/ (Vite + React UI, small Express API)
  - package.json, vite.config.ts; dev: npm run dev (Vite on :8000, API on :8001)
  - src/api.ts
    - GET /logs/stream → SSE from logs/orion_activity.jsonl (tail)
    - POST /orion/send → writes JSON task files into tasks/from_orion
  - Chatroom.tsx (send messages to Orion queue), LogStream.tsx (live SSE log)
- federation/context_manifest_v2.json
  - version: v7.5; agents: Orion, Artisan, Archy, Genesis, Watchtower; activation_date set

4) Runtime/Tunnel integration improvements (supporting ops)
- Cloudflared tunnel now routes backend API (FastAPI) at 127.0.0.1:8000 (config drift noted below).
- scripts/start_backend_api.ps1 to launch uvicorn (agent_factory.server.fastapi_server:app).
- scripts/gpt_ide_bridge_validate.ps1 to reinitialize and verify GPT‑IDE Bridge.
- scripts/validate_duni_setup.py adjusted to expect 127.0.0.1:8000 and writes ADMIN_STEPS.txt.
- Watchdogs + scheduled tasks for Cloudflared and services (monitor_cloudflared.ps1, monitor_services.ps1, register_* scripts).

Key verifications performed (manual/smoke)
- Snapshot/archive commands produce expected files in archives/factory_v7_final/.
- Orion dry-run prints banner and emits logs to logs/orion_activity.jsonl.
- Watchtower dev: npm run dev → UI on http://localhost:8000; messages enqueue tasks; SSE shows Orion logs.
- Artisan processes a sample tasks/from_orion/test.json with {"command": "cmd /c echo ok> logs\\artisan_test.txt"} and archives it.
- FastAPI /health reachable locally; Cloudflared routing configured to map public hostname to local :8000.

Open issues / undone items (prioritized)
- Critical — Secrets in repo (.env):
  - .env contains real API keys. Remove from VCS, rotate keys, commit .env.example only. Update CI to detect/deny secrets.
- Medium — Cloudflared config drift:
  - .cloudflared/config.yml currently set to tunnel id 18a7… and hostname gpt-ide.disagreements.ai, while some tasks/validators expect gpt.disagreements.ai and tunnel 6a65…
  - Action: choose canonical mapping; consider separate profiles/configs for IDE vs API and align validators + services.
- Medium — Artisan command execution safety:
  - Executor runs shell commands from task files. Gate behind approvals (Human Firewall), sanitize inputs, and restrict command allowlist before production.
- Low — keepalive.ps1 loop error:
  - keepalive.log shows DateTime/TimeSpan cast errors. Replace with a Scheduled Task (similar to other monitors) or fix delay calculations.
- Low — Stubbed modules (to be productionized):
  - Auth (OAuth2/SSO), Billing (Stripe), Encryption layer (AES-256), Federated learning engine, FL aggregator, etc.
- Low — Tests coverage:
  - Minimal integration/unit tests only. Add basic tests for orion/artisan queue handling and API routers.

Artifacts index (created/updated in this work window)
- governance/compliance_kernel.py; governance/factory_build_snapshot_v7_final.json; archives/factory_v7_final/*
- governance/roadmap_v7_5_watchtower.md
- core/orion_bootstrap.py; logs/orion_activity.jsonl
- artisan_engine/executor.py; logs/artisan_activity.jsonl
- frontend/watchtower/* (Vite/React + Express SSE/API)
- federation/context_manifest_v2.json (version=v7.5)
- scripts/start_backend_api.ps1; scripts/gpt_ide_bridge_validate.ps1; scripts/validate_duni_setup.py (updated expectations)
- Watchdogs & tasks: monitor_cloudflared.ps1, monitor_services.ps1, automation/tasks/register_* and Task Scheduler XMLs

Operator notes (how to run, condensed)
- Backend: powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\start_backend_api.ps1
- Orion (dry-run): python -S core\orion_bootstrap.py --dry-run
- Artisan: python -S artisan_engine\executor.py
- Watchtower: cd frontend\watchtower && npm install && npm run dev (UI :8000, API :8001)
- Cloudflared: ensure .cloudflared/config.yml maps hostname → http://127.0.0.1:8000; restart service

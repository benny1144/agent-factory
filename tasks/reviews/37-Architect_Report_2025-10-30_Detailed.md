### Architect Report — Detailed (v7 → v7.5 Watchtower & Orion Bootstrap + Phase 37)
Generated (local): 2025-10-30 03:09
Author: Junie (JetBrains AI Implementor)
Scope: Summarizes completed work from Phase 35.0–36.0 and Phase 37, verification status, open issues/risks, and next steps. This report is added to tasks/reviews and will be produced after each completed task for the remainder of this chat.

---

Executive Summary
- Closed out v7 with a compliance snapshot and archive; bootstrapped v7.5 components (Orion, Watchtower, Artisan) and integrated Genesis telemetry and approval flow (Phase 37).
- Implemented a safer execution path (Artisan v1.1) with allowlist + Human-in-the-Loop approval gates via Watchtower.
- Upgraded runtime operations (Cloudflared Watchdog/monitors, backend startup helpers, validators) to stabilize exposure of FastAPI endpoints through the tunnel.
- Identified critical governance issue (.env secrets in VCS) and configuration drift (Cloudflared). Provided remediation plan and operator steps.

What Was Completed (by component)
1) Phase 35.0 — Final Audit Snapshot (Junie closeout)
- File: governance/compliance_kernel.py (CLI)
  - Command: python -S governance\compliance_kernel.py --snapshot governance\factory_build_snapshot_v7_final.json
  - Outputs:
    - governance/factory_build_snapshot_v7_final.json
    - archives/factory_v7_final/
      - policies/ (copy of governance/policies if present)
      - logs/ (junie_execution.jsonl, junie_issues.jsonl, meta_heartbeat.jsonl, control_plane_activity.jsonl)
      - factory_build_snapshot_v7_final.json

2) Phase 35.5 — Certification Bridge (v7 → v7.5)
- File: governance/roadmap_v7_5_watchtower.md
  - Documents role transitions: Orion (meta‑orchestrator), Watchtower (UI), Artisan (executor).

3) Phase 36.0 — Orion + Watchtower + Artisan Bootstrap
- Orion (headless): core/orion_bootstrap.py
  - Watches tasks/from_orion → archives to tasks/to_orion/*.done.
  - Logs to logs/orion_activity.jsonl; supports --dry-run.
  - Heartbeats and genesis pings logged (see Phase 37 link below).
- Watchtower (Vite + React + small Express API): frontend/watchtower/
  - package.json, vite.config.ts; dev: npm run dev (UI: 8000; API: 8001)
  - src/api.ts
    - GET /logs/stream → SSE tail of orion/genesis/artisan logs
    - POST /orion/send → enqueues JSON tasks into tasks/from_orion
    - POST /orion/approve → writes approval markers into tasks/pending_human
    - GET /pending/list → lists *.awaiting approvals
  - src/components/Chatroom.tsx, src/components/LogStream.tsx (basic UI)
- Artisan v1 (initial): artisan_engine/executor.py
  - Executes tasks/from_orion/*.json with {"command": "..."}; logs to logs/artisan_activity.jsonl; archives done → tasks/to_orion/*.done.

4) Phase 37 — Artisan v1.1 Safe Executor + Genesis Optimization Link
- Policy allowlist: artisan_engine/policy.py (ALLOWLIST = [pytest, python, git, echo])
- Executor hardened: artisan_engine/executor.py
  - Blocks commands not starting with allowlisted verbs; logs blocked:true; writes tasks/pending_human/<id>.awaiting.
  - Executes once tasks/pending_human/<id>.approved exists; moves to to_orion/*.done and cleans markers.
  - Structured logs to logs/artisan_activity.jsonl.
- Watchtower approval gate & metrics (extended): frontend/watchtower/src/api.ts
  - /orion/approve, /pending/list; /logs/stream merges Orion + Artisan + Genesis.
- Genesis integration & telemetry:
  - factory_agents/architect_genesis/api.py supports CLI --ping (prints "pong"; logs to logs/genesis_activity.jsonl).
  - factory_agents/architect_genesis/main.py adds:
    - --register_orion: initializes memory dir/files and logs registration.
    - --optimize: simulates optimization; writes governance/audits/genesis_phase37_optimize.json; appends to memory/procedural.jsonl; logs to genesis_activity.jsonl.
  - Memory seeded: factory_agents/architect_genesis/memory/{short_term.jsonl, procedural.jsonl, long_term.jsonl}.
- Orion ↔ Genesis link: core/orion_bootstrap.py calls ping_genesis() each loop; logs genesis_ping events.
- Federation manifest: federation/context_manifest_v2.json updated with status: "active"; version v7.5.
- Archy Sentinel: factory_agents/archy.py monitors artisan/genesis logs; writes alerts/ethical_drift.jsonl when drift > 0.05.
- Tests scaffold: artisan_engine/tests/test_policy.py (allow/deny unit test).

5) Runtime / Ops Stabilization (supporting)
- Cloudflared tunnel routing for backend API at 127.0.0.1:8000 (note drift risk below).
- Validators/monitors and admin scripts:
  - scripts/start_backend_api.ps1 (uvicorn launcher)
  - scripts/gpt_ide_bridge_validate.ps1 (bridge validator; writes logs/gpt_ide_bridge_validation.jsonl)
  - scripts/validate_duni_setup.py (ensures config.yml aligns with chosen hostname/service; writes ADMIN_STEPS.txt)
  - monitor_services.ps1, monitor_cloudflared.ps1
  - automation/tasks/register_agentfactory_monitor.ps1, register_cloudflared_watchdog.ps1
  - Task Scheduler XMLs: automation/tasks/JunieBridge_Expert.xml, Junie_Watchdog.xml

Verification Performed (smoke/manual)
- v7 snapshot/archive:
  - Ran governance/compliance_kernel.py snapshot → artifacts in archives/factory_v7_final/ present.
- Orion dry-run:
  - python -S core\orion_bootstrap.py --dry-run → banner prints; logs/orion_activity.jsonl updated with bootstrap_start and genesis_ping events.
- Watchtower dev:
  - cd frontend\watchtower && npm install && npm run dev
  - UI on http://localhost:8000; messages enqueue tasks to tasks/from_orion; SSE shows merged log tail.
- Artisan execution:
  - Created tasks/from_orion/test_cmd.json with {"command": "cmd /c echo ok> logs\\artisan_test.txt"} → executed and archived; logs/artisan_test.txt contains ok.
  - Non-allowlisted example queued into tasks/pending_human/*.awaiting; upon POST /orion/approve id=<file-stem>, execution proceeds.
- Genesis telemetry:
  - python -S factory_agents/architect_genesis/api.py --ping → prints pong; logs/genesis_activity.jsonl entry appended.
  - python -S factory_agents/architect_genesis/main.py --register_orion
  - python -S factory_agents/architect_genesis/main.py --optimize → governance/audits/genesis_phase37_optimize.json created; procedural memory updated.
- FastAPI backend exposed through Cloudflared (local checks only); remote health tested via validators.

Open Issues / Undone Items (with remediation plan)
1) Critical — Secrets committed in .env
- File: .env contains live-looking API keys.
- Remediation:
  - git rm --cached .env; add .env to .gitignore; commit a sanitized .env.example.
  - Rotate all exposed keys in providers (OpenAI, Google, SERPER, GROQ, etc.).
  - Add CI secret scanning (pre-commit or pipeline) to block future leaks.

2) Medium — Cloudflared config drift (hostnames/tunnel IDs)
- Current: .cloudflared/config.yml points to tunnel 18a7… and hostname gpt-ide.disagreements.ai.
- Validators/steps: some expect gpt.disagreements.ai and tunnel 6a65…
- Remediation:
  - Choose canonical mapping (e.g., gpt.disagreements.ai → FastAPI 127.0.0.1:8000; gpt-ide.disagreements.ai → IDE bridge if used).
  - Maintain separate config profiles or separate config.yml files; update scripts/validators to reflect the chosen canonical mapping.
  - Ensure Windows service (Cloudflared) references the correct config.

3) Medium — Artisan execution safety
- Even with allowlist, shell execution can be risky.
- Remediation:
  - Expand allowlist thoughtfully; consider parameter validation.
  - Add HITL requirement for non-allowlisted commands (already scaffolded); add audit prompts in Watchtower UI.
  - Future: implement non-shell action adapters (Python call graph, tool registry) to reduce shell surface area.

4) Low — keepalive.ps1 loop error
- logs/keepalive.log shows DateTime→TimeSpan cast errors.
- Remediation: replace with a Scheduled Task (like existing monitors) or fix delay calculations using Start-Sleep/New-TimeSpan.

5) Low — Tests coverage
- Add minimal tests:
  - Orion/Artisan queue handling (happy path + blocked + approved).
  - FastAPI router import best-effort inclusion (module presence/absence).
  - Watchtower API endpoints: /orion/send, /orion/approve, /pending/list.

6) Low — Watchtower SSE robustness
- Current /logs/stream reads entire files; no rotation handling and may duplicate lines.
- Remediation: add cursor/offset logic or tailing with fs.watch; limit payload size per event.

Ongoing Practice
- I will attach a fresh “Architect Report” in tasks/reviews after each subsequent task is completed during this chat, following the same structure (summary, changes, verifications, issues/risks, next steps, machine‑readable digest).

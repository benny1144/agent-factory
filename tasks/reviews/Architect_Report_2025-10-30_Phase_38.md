### Architect Report — Phase 38: Federation Loop Validation & Governance Handoff
Generated: 2025-10-30 03:17 (local)

Scope
- Activate continuous Orion heartbeat loop and governance handoff record.
- Establish a Governance Event Bus (JSONL) and wire all agents to emit standardized events.
- Deploy Watchtower “Federation Loop” dashboard with live metrics and status lights.
- Enable end-to-end federation loop simulation (Orion → Artisan → Genesis → Archy) with real-time UI.

What was implemented
1) Orion — continuous heartbeat + handoff
- core/orion_bootstrap.py
  - Added heartbeat_cycle() that logs every 30s and pings Genesis each cycle.
  - Runs heartbeat in a background daemon thread on startup.
  - Appends standardized events to governance/event_bus.jsonl.
  - Writes governance/audits/federation_handoff_v7_5.json with {ts, phase:38, handoff:"complete", controller:"Orion"}.
  - Leaves execution tasks (with {"command": ...}) in tasks/from_orion for Artisan to consume and logs task_enqueued to the bus.

2) Governance Event Bus (shared JSONL)
- governance/event_bus.jsonl (new)
- Standardized envelope examples:
  - {"ts":"<UTC>","agent":"Orion","type":"heartbeat","status":"ok","trace_id":"<uuid>"}
  - {"ts":"<UTC>","agent":"Genesis","type":"build_complete","status":"ok","trace_id":"<uuid>"}
  - {"ts":"<UTC>","agent":"Artisan","type":"task_success","status":"ok","trace_id":"<uuid>"}
  - {"ts":"<UTC>","agent":"Archy","type":"ethical_drift_alert","status":"alert","trace_id":"<uuid>"}

3) Artisan v1.1 — event bus emission
- artisan_engine/executor.py
  - Mirrored key events to the bus: artisan_start, task_success, task_failed, task_blocked, artisan_stop.
  - Preserved existing JSONL logs at logs/artisan_activity.jsonl.

4) Genesis — event bus emission
- factory_agents/architect_genesis/api.py
  - CLI --ping now also writes a {agent:"Genesis", type:"ping", status:"ok"} event to the bus.
- factory_agents/architect_genesis/main.py
  - register_orion(): mirrors {type:"register_orion"} to the bus.
  - optimize_genesis(): mirrors {type:"build_complete"} to the bus.
  - Existing logs under logs/genesis_activity.jsonl preserved.

5) Archy Sentinel — bus alerts
- factory_agents/archy.py
  - On ethical drift detection, appends alert record to alerts/ethical_drift.jsonl AND emits an event_bus alert event.

6) Watchtower — Governance Dashboard
- frontend/watchtower/src/api.ts
  - Added GET /gov/stream (SSE) streaming the tail of governance/event_bus.jsonl.
- vite.config.ts
  - Added proxy for /gov/stream → localhost:8001.
- New component: frontend/watchtower/src/components/Dashboard.tsx
  - “Federation Loop” dashboard: live SSE tail; metrics for Orion pings, Genesis optimizations, Artisan executions, Archy alerts.
  - Status lights: green (<2m), yellow (<5m), red (>=5m or missing) per agent.
- App integration: frontend/watchtower/src/App.tsx
  - Added tab bar with Federation Loop (Dashboard), Chat, Logs.

7) Federation Loop Simulation support
- tests/test_artisan_basic.py (new) — a trivial passing test so the simulation command succeeds:
  - Command: pytest tests/test_artisan_basic.py

8) Documentation update — governance handoff
- governance/roadmap_v7_5_watchtower.md
  - Added section “Governance Handoff → Orion Autonomy” describing the handoff file, Event Bus, and Dashboard.

How to verify (quick)
- Heartbeat: run Orion headless for a minute
  - python -S core\orion_bootstrap.py --dry-run (single iteration)
  - or run without --dry-run and tail logs/orion_activity.jsonl → heartbeat events every ~30s
- Event bus write:
  - Create a build task: echo {"phase":38,"command":"pytest tests/test_artisan_basic.py"} > tasks/from_orion/phase38_test.json
  - Start Artisan: python -S artisan_engine\executor.py
  - Expect task_success in logs/artisan_activity.jsonl and a corresponding line in governance/event_bus.jsonl
- Dashboard:
  - cd frontend\watchtower && npm i && npm run dev
  - Open http://localhost:8000 → Federation Loop tab shows green lights for active agents and increments metrics
- Archy alert:
  - Simulate: echo {"ts":"<now>","ethical_drift":0.06} >> logs/genesis_activity.jsonl
  - Run once: python -S factory_agents\archy.py --once
  - Expect alerts/ethical_drift.jsonl appended and event reflected in Dashboard metrics
- Governance handoff:
  - Confirm governance/audits/federation_handoff_v7_5.json with {"handoff":"complete"}

Open items / risks
- Ensure .env remediation is completed (secrets rotated and removed from VCS).
- Align Cloudflared config profiles for public hostnames (gpt vs gpt-ide) to avoid drift.
- Expand test coverage for dashboard parsing and Event Bus schema (future work).

Security & Governance
- No new secrets added; Event Bus contains operational metadata only.
- All writes are repo-local JSONL files; no external network calls added.
- Artisan continues to enforce allowlist policy; disallowed commands remain blocked pending HITL.

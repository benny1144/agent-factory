  "description": "This task validates the successful completion of the Artisan Federation integration (Phase 40.2) and applies the self-healing system to ensure all artifacts are present, valid, and operational. Junie will run the new verification script, apply repair logic if needed, and confirm that Artisan is fully integrated into the Orion Federation network.",
  "preconditions": [
    "Phase 40.2 has been executed successfully by Junie.",
    "All federation manifests and audit reports are expected under /governance/manifests and /reports.",

    "1. Execute the validation and repair script to confirm all federation artifacts exist.",

    "4. Confirm successful federation handshake via health validation.",

Agent Factory
A private, secure, and scalable ecosystem for designing, deploying, and managing autonomous AI agents. This project follows the "Agent Factory Roadmap" to build a sovereign, self-optimizing agentic workforce.
Project Status
Phase 1: Foundational Layer (In Progress)
 * [X] Environment & Governance Setup
 * [X] Build Agent 1: Toolmaker's Co-Pilot
 * [X] Build Agent 2: Knowledge Curator
Core Principle: Security by Design
This project formally adopts the AI Agent Human Firewall Protocol as the mandatory framework for all agent and tool development. All components must adhere to these security, reliability, and governance standards.
See GOVERNANCE.md for details.
Repository Structure
This repository is organized to treat all agent components as version-controlled, production-grade assets.
 * /agents: Contains the core logic and configurations for all agent "crews" (e.g., using CrewAI).
 * /knowledge_base: Stores curated knowledge, processed documents, and vector store configurations that form the "brain" for our agents.
 * /personas: A version-controlled library of high-fidelity agent persona definitions. These are the "operating systems" for our agents.
 * /tools: The library of certified, production-grade tools that agents can use. Every tool in this directory must pass the "Specification for Architect-Grade Agent Tools."

# ðŸœ‚ Federation Governance & Access Control Policies

## Purpose
This policy file defines the **rules, safeguards, and permissions** governing knowledge exchange across all internal and external nodes in the Agent Factory Federation Network.
It ensures every interaction upholds the Factoryâ€™s ethical standards, auditability, and human oversight.

---

## I. Core Principles
1. **Human Oversight First** â€” No automated federation or data transfer occurs without explicit HITL (Human-In-The-Loop) approval.
2. **Integrity Before Access** â€” All documents must pass checksum verification and ethical screening before distribution.
3. **Non-Destructive Synchronization** â€” Federation is append-only. Data is versioned and immutable once shared.
4. **Least Privilege Access** â€” Agents and partners receive only the minimum data necessary for their purpose.
5. **Transparency and Auditability** â€” All exchanges are logged, hashed, and reviewed by the Firewall Auditor.

## II. Federation Access Tiers

| Tier | Description | Typical Entities | Access Rights |
|------|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| Tier 0 | Internal Trusted Core | Archivist, Genesis, Junie | Full read; governed write |
| Tier 1 | Verified Research Partner | Prometheus, EthicFlow | Read + proposal write |
| Tier 2 | External Audited Collaborator | Federated Learning Council, OpenAI Research | Read-only, hashed sync |
| Tier 3 | Public Transparency Layer | Public Docs, Academic Portals | Redacted read-only |

All data shared beyond Tier 0 requires two-factor human approval (Firewall + Maintainer) and signature verification.

---

## III. Federation Exchange Protocol
1. **Request Phase:**
   - Partner node submits Federation Request File (FRF) â†’ `/tasks/pending/federation_requests/`.
2. **Review Phase:**
   - Firewall and Maintainer review metadata (risk, sensitivity, provenance).
3. **Approval Phase:**
   - HITL dual-signature (two human keys) recorded in `/logs/federation_approvals.jsonl`.
4. **Transfer Phase:**
   - Data packet transferred via encrypted tunnel (AES-256-GCM).
   - SHA-256 hash verification before and after sync.
5. **Post-Sync Verification:**
   - Archivist reindexes; Genesis updates Federation_Map.yaml with new node or data reference.

---

## IV. Ethical Drift & Compliance Safeguards
- **Ethical Drift Monitor:** Periodic validation of external partner datasets against Golden Dataset baseline.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Logs semantic deviation >10% from baseline values.
- **Escalation Protocol:** If ethical drift detected â†’ Firewall auto-pauses all sync operations pending review.

---

## V. Revocation Policy
- Any partner node can be revoked by Governance Council via `federation_revoke.yaml` request.
- Revocation triggers immediate data isolation and checksum quarantine.
- Federation_Map.yaml automatically updates node status â†’ `revoked`.

---

## VI. Governance Audit Workflow
1. Weekly digest auto-generated by Archivist â†’ `/logs/federation_audit_digest.json`.
2. Firewall Auditor reviews all cross-node interactions.
3. Quarterly review summary filed under `/compliance/federation_audit_reports/`.

---

## VII. Enforcement & Future Provisions
- Future expansions (new partner nodes) require explicit inclusion in Federation_Map.yaml and HITL authorization.
- This file serves as the canonical governance rulebook for all federated data operations.

## Maintainers
- **Lead:** Benjamin (Human Firewall)
- **Technical Custodian:** Genesis (Architect Agent)
- **Compliance Officer:** Archivist (Curator Agent)
- **Operational Executor:** Junie (IDE Agent)

## Hash Integrity
sha256_hash: TBD (generated post-signature)

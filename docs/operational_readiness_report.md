## 2. Architecture Overview
A governed, multiâ€‘agent system with auditability and adaptive optimization:
- Compliance & Audit Kernel: JSON structured logs with optional OTEL/GCP forwarding; helpers for agent, tool, and ingestion events.
- Procedural Memory (DB): SQLAlchemy Core with tables â€” agent_runs, tool_registry, knowledge_ingest, memory_events, memory_weights, governance_history. Context manager trace_run and helpers for insert/select. SQLite fallback.
- Cognitive Engine Federation: MemoryEngine with pluggable adapters (faiss, qdrant, redis). Emits [AUDIT] memory_* events and persists memory_events.
- Knowledge Curator 2.0: Multi-format ingestion (.txt/.md/.pdf/.csv), provenance JSON per source, audit logging, and memory insertions.
- Human Firewall Protocol: require_hitl and personaâ€‘aware require_risk with escalation tiers (HITL/HOTL/HOOTL) and risk_matrix.json.
- Telemetry & Drift Monitoring: EthicalDriftMonitor computes drift and logs telemetry to artifacts/telemetry/*.jsonl; summarize via telemetry_summary.json.
- Optimization Feedback Loop: FeedbackLoop adjusts memory_weights using drift telemetry; logs optimization_adjustment metric.
- Governance Console: FastAPI app exposing /, /drift, /optimization and /api/audit for local compliance review.

## 3. Compliance & Governance Trace
Key files and services:
- Audit Kernel: src/agent_factory/services/audit/audit_logger.py
- Firewall Protocol: utils/firewall_protocol.py (+ personas/risk_matrix.json)
- Procedural Memory: utils/procedural_memory_pg.py (tables: agent_runs, tool_registry, knowledge_ingest, memory_events, memory_weights, governance_history)
- Knowledge Curator: agents/knowledge_curator/curate.py (writes knowledge_base/provenance/*.json)
- Memory Federation: src/agent_factory/services/memory/*
- Telemetry: utils/telemetry.py â†’ artifacts/telemetry/
- Console & API: src/agent_factory/console/app.py and /api.py

Governance mechanisms:
- HITL/HOTL/HOOTL gating for sensitive actions (e.g., memory deletion @require_risk("HIGH")).
- Personaâ€‘based escalation via personas/risk_matrix.json.
- Appendâ€‘only HITL log at artifacts/hitl_actions.jsonl mirrored to governance_history table.

---

## 4. Ethical & Safety Evaluation
- Drift stability: EthicalDriftMonitor emits [DRIFT] events; no sustained alerts beyond thresholds in CI runs.
- Audit completeness: [AUDIT] entries visible across unit tests and CI artifacts; console /api/audit lists audit files.
- Retraining: Phase 6 retrains ethical_baseline_v2.json deterministically from approved HITL actions.

---

## 5. Governance Readiness Checklist
- âœ… Compliance & Audit Kernel operational
- âœ… Procedural Memory v2/v3 tables created and populated
- âœ… Knowledge Curator with provenance coverage (100% where ingests exist)
- âœ… Memory Federation + adapters wired with audit trails
- âœ… Ethical Drift telemetry generated and summarized
- âœ… Optimization feedback applied to memory_weights
- âœ… Governance Console renders telemetry and audit status
- âœ… HITL actions logged (file + DB), persona escalation audited

---

## 6. Final Compliance Gate (OGM v1.0)
Certification by Architect confirming all systems passed governance verification and audit trace.

---

## 7. Recommended Next Actions
- Archive CI and governance artifacts to Compliance Kernel (GCP Logging/Audit Workspace) with SHAâ€‘256 hashes.
- Optional: Generate a signed PDF of this report for external auditors.
- Optional: Deploy Governance Console to internal Cloud Run.
- Optional: Enable Crossâ€‘Agent Ethical Consistency (CAEC) metrics in telemetry.

## âœ… Final Statement
> Agent Factory v1.0 is fully operational and meets all ethical, compliance, and governance standards.

## 2. Architecture Overview
A governed, multiâ€‘agent system with auditability and adaptive optimization:
- Compliance & Audit Kernel: JSON structured logs with optional OTEL/GCP forwarding; helpers for agent, tool, and ingestion events.
- Procedural Memory (DB): SQLAlchemy Core with tables â€” agent_runs, tool_registry, knowledge_ingest, memory_events, memory_weights, governance_history. Context manager trace_run and helpers for insert/select. SQLite fallback.
- Cognitive Engine Federation: MemoryEngine with pluggable adapters (faiss, qdrant, redis). Emits [AUDIT] memory_* events and persists memory_events.
- Knowledge Curator 2.0: Multi-format ingestion (.txt/.md/.pdf/.csv), provenance JSON per source, audit logging, and memory insertions.
- Human Firewall Protocol: require_hitl and personaâ€‘aware require_risk with escalation tiers (HITL/HOTL/HOOTL) and risk_matrix.json.
- Telemetry & Drift Monitoring: EthicalDriftMonitor computes drift and logs telemetry to artifacts/telemetry/*.jsonl; summarize via telemetry_summary.json.
- Optimization Feedback Loop: FeedbackLoop adjusts memory_weights using drift telemetry; logs optimization_adjustment metric.
- Governance Console: FastAPI app exposing /, /drift, /optimization and /api/audit for local compliance review.

---

## 3. Compliance & Governance Trace
Key files and services:
- Audit Kernel: src/agent_factory/services/audit/audit_logger.py
- Firewall Protocol: utils/firewall_protocol.py (+ personas/risk_matrix.json)
- Procedural Memory: utils/procedural_memory_pg.py (tables: agent_runs, tool_registry, knowledge_ingest, memory_events, memory_weights, governance_history)
- Knowledge Curator: agents/knowledge_curator/curate.py (writes knowledge_base/provenance/*.json)
- Memory Federation: src/agent_factory/services/memory/*
- Telemetry: utils/telemetry.py â†’ artifacts/telemetry/
- Console & API: src/agent_factory/console/app.py and /api.py

Governance mechanisms:
- HITL/HOTL/HOOTL gating for sensitive actions (e.g., memory deletion @require_risk("HIGH")).
- Personaâ€‘based escalation via personas/risk_matrix.json.
- Appendâ€‘only HITL log at artifacts/hitl_actions.jsonl mirrored to governance_history table.

---

## 4. Ethical & Safety Evaluation
- Drift stability: EthicalDriftMonitor emits [DRIFT] events; no sustained alerts beyond thresholds in CI runs.
- Audit completeness: [AUDIT] entries visible across unit tests and CI artifacts; console /api/audit lists audit files.
- Retraining: Phase 6 retrains ethical_baseline_v2.json deterministically from approved HITL actions.

---

## 5. Governance Readiness Checklist
- âœ… Compliance & Audit Kernel operational
- âœ… Procedural Memory v2/v3 tables created and populated
- âœ… Knowledge Curator with provenance coverage (100% where ingests exist)
- âœ… Memory Federation + adapters wired with audit trails
- âœ… Ethical Drift telemetry generated and summarized
- âœ… Optimization feedback applied to memory_weights
- âœ… Governance Console renders telemetry and audit status
- âœ… HITL actions logged (file + DB), persona escalation audited

---

## 6. Final Compliance Gate (OGM v1.0)
Certification by Architect confirming all systems passed governance verification and audit trace.

---

## 7. Recommended Next Actions
- Archive CI and governance artifacts to Compliance Kernel (GCP Logging/Audit Workspace) with SHAâ€‘256 hashes.
- Optional: Generate a signed PDF of this report for external auditors.
- Optional: Deploy Governance Console to internal Cloud Run.
- Optional: Enable Crossâ€‘Agent Ethical Consistency (CAEC) metrics in telemetry.

---

## âœ… Final Statement
> Agent Factory v1.0 is fully operational and meets all ethical, compliance, and governance standards.

## Addendum 1 â€” Knowledge Base Archive (KBA) Integration

Date: October 2025  
Phase Reference: 3.2 (Knowledge Continuity Foundation)

Summary:
- 9 core governance PDFs integrated under `/knowledge_base/core/`
- Registry indexed in `metadata_index.json` with SHA256 verification
- CI workflow `agent-factory-ci.yml` performs automated registry validation
- Makefile targets `validate-kba` and `audit-kba` enable local/CI verification
- Audit artifact: `artifacts/kba_validation.log`

Validation:
- [KBA] Verified 9 entries successfully.
- [AUDIT] Registry integrity and checksum validation complete.

Governance Ledger Entry: **AF-KBA/OGM-2025-Audit02**


## Phase 6 â€” Continuous Oversight (OGM v1.1 Activation)

Date: October 25, 2025

Summary:
- Added persistent governance event logging with structured DB table `governance_events` (append-only) alongside existing `governance_history`.
- Enhanced HITL Logger to append JSONL, mirror to DB, and emit `[AUDIT] hitl_action` for Cloud Logging.
- Introduced daily Governance Sync CI workflow (`.github/workflows/governance-sync.yml`) to aggregate audit/telemetry/HITL into a daily digest and optional GCS upload (bucket: `agent-factory-audit`).
- Retraining pipeline now considers mean drift (`artifacts/telemetry/ethical_drift.jsonl`) and updates baseline only when threshold exceeded; emits `[RETRAIN]` audit events.
- Added governance report generator that compiles digest, baseline metadata, and recent governance events into `artifacts/governance_report_<timestamp>.md`.

Artifacts:
- `artifacts/audit_digest_<date>.json`
- `artifacts/governance_report_<timestamp>.md`
- `artifacts/hitl_actions.jsonl`
- `data/ethical_baseline_v2.json` (+ alias `data/ethical_baseline.json`)

Verification:
- `[HITL]` entries observed and mirrored to DB (`governance_events`).
- `[DRIFT]` and `[OPTIMIZE]` telemetry present under `artifacts/telemetry/`.
- `[RETRAIN]` audit events logged; baseline updated only when drift > 0.35.
- Governance Sync job successful; daily digest uploaded to GCS when credentials available.

Governance Ledger Entry:
- Key: **AF-GOV/OGM-2025-Audit04**
- Title: Phase 6 â€” Continuous Oversight & Ethical Retraining
- Result: All oversight and retraining systems operational.
- Artifacts: `artifacts/governance_report_<timestamp>.md`, `gs://agent-factory-audit/audit_digest_<date>.json`


## Phase 6 Verification Summary

Description
- Continuous oversight is active via append-only HITL governance logs (artifacts/hitl_actions.jsonl), mirrored to DB tables governance_history and governance_events.
- Daily governance sync aggregates telemetry + audit into a digest and uploads artifacts when configured.
- Ethical retraining pipeline updates data/ethical_baseline_v2.json only when mean drift exceeds threshold (default 0.35), emitting [RETRAIN] audit entries.

Evidence
- HITL â†’ RETRAIN â†’ baseline update flow executed end-to-end during Phase 6:
  - HITL simulation logged: artifacts/hitl_actions.jsonl (and DB mirrors)
  - Retraining emitted [RETRAIN] audit entries and wrote data/ethical_baseline_v2.json
  - Telemetry present under artifacts/telemetry/ (ethical_drift.jsonl, optimization_adjustment.jsonl)
- CI job reference: .github/workflows/governance-sync.yml (scheduled daily; manual dispatch supported)

Dashboards (GCP)
- Governance Console & Monitoring dashboards show [HITL] and [RETRAIN] metrics.
- Example entry points (project-specific):
  - Cloud Monitoring: https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/dashboards
  - Cloud Logging: https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/query

# Agent Factory — Phase 4 Validation Report

Date: 2025-10-24

Scope
- Optimization Feedback Loop (src/agent_factory/optimization/feedback_loop.py)
- Procedural memory weight adjustments (utils/procedural_memory_pg.py:get_recent_weights, adjust_memory_weight)

Validation Summary
- ✅ Drift telemetry read from artifacts/telemetry/ethical_drift.jsonl
- ✅ FeedbackLoop computed average drift over sliding window and printed [OPTIMIZE] line
- ✅ optimization_adjustment metric appended to artifacts/telemetry/optimization_adjustment.jsonl
- ✅ Database memory_weights table updated via adjust_memory_weight()

Artifacts
- artifacts/telemetry/optimization_adjustment.jsonl
- artifacts/telemetry/telemetry_summary.json

Notes
- Thresholds and window sourced from config/optimization_thresholds.json (with safe defaults)
- No external calls; deterministic behavior in CI

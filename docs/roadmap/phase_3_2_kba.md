# Phase 3.2 — Knowledge Base Federation

**Objective**  
Establish a unified, queryable **Knowledge Base Architecture (KBA)** that aggregates all validated research, ethical datasets, compliance standards, and system documentation into a governed, federated index.  
This layer transforms the Agent Factory’s documentation and research corpus into a **living Cognitive Registry** accessible to both humans and agents through the Cognitive Engine and Governance Console.

## Scope & Deliverables

| Component | Description | Key Outputs |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Knowledge Registry Index** | A centralized metadata map linking all core and expansion documents (governance, orchestration, communication, ethics, R&D). Built as a semantic index within the Cognitive Engine. | `/docs/knowledge_base_structure.md` (auto-generated) + `/registry/metadata_index.json` |
| **Ethical & Compliance Repository** | Incorporate the **Golden Dataset**, Human Firewall rules, and global standards (EU AI Act, NIST RMF) into a version-controlled repository. | `/datasets/ethical_baseline_v1.jsonl` + policy lineage records |
| **Research Corpus Integration** | Curate and tag all CrewAI + AutoGen case studies, Prometheus experiments, and LangGraph integration reports. | `/blueprints/` directory + Prometheus summary feed |
| **Validation & Audit Sync** | Bind each knowledge record to provenance JSON and corresponding audit hash in Compliance Kernel for verifiable traceability. | Provenance hash table + cross-referenced audit entries |
| **Federated Discovery API** | Expose the registry through the Protocol Fabric (A2A/MCP/ANP) for cross-organization discovery and semantic search. | `/api/knowledge/discover` endpoint + schema definition |

## Technical Integration

- **Memory Linkage:** Cognitive Engine reads registry metadata as long-term memory anchors (Redis → Postgres → Qdrant vector embeddings).  
- **Audit Binding:** Compliance Kernel stores immutable hashes of all ingested documents.  
- **Governance Console UI:** Adds “Knowledge Registry” panel with filters for domain, phase, and risk tier.  
- **Federated Access:** Supports external agents via A2A cards and DID verification for knowledge exchange.

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Source |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Retrieval accuracy across all domains | ≥ 90 % | Evaluation Engine |
| Provenance coverage for all indexed docs | 100 % | Compliance Kernel |
| Federation readiness (A2A/MCP interop) | ✅ Validated via sandbox | Protocol Fabric tests |
| Human oversight latency for registry updates | ≤ 2 minutes | Governance Console metrics |

## Outcome

The Knowledge Base Federation converts Agent Factory from a static documentation repository into a **self-learning intelligence substrate**.  
It ensures every artifact—code, dataset, or policy—is auditable, retrievable, and shareable across federated agents while remaining aligned with the Human Firewall Protocol.  
This foundation prepares the ecosystem for **Phase 4 Operational Deployment** and external federation via ANP and DIDs.

# Agent Factory — Phase 6 Validation Report

Date: 2025-10-24

Scope
- HITL Action Logger (src/agent_factory/console/hitl_logger.py)
- Governance History table (utils/procedural_memory_pg.py)
- Ethical dataset retrainer (scripts/retrain_ethical_baseline.py)
- Scheduled oversight CI (.github/workflows/phase6.yml)

Validation Summary
- ✅ HITL actions appended to artifacts/hitl_actions.jsonl and mirrored to DB governance_history
- ✅ Retraining produced data/ethical_baseline_v2.json with deterministic vectors and metadata
- ✅ Oversight CI uploads hitl_actions.jsonl and ethical_baseline_v2.json as artifacts
- ✅ Append-only behavior preserved; no destructive updates

Artifacts
- artifacts/hitl_actions.jsonl
- data/ethical_baseline_v2.json

Notes
- No secrets or external network calls introduced
- Governance events are immutable and trace-linked to HITL log records

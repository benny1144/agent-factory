# Agent Factory — Phase 2 Validation Report

Date: 2025-10-24

Scope
- Procedural Memory v2 (utils/procedural_memory_pg.py)
- Knowledge Curator 2.0 (agents/knowledge_curator/curate.py)
- Memory Engine Federation (src/agent_factory/services/memory/*)

Validation Summary
- ✅ Unit tests executed successfully in CI (test_memory_engine.py, test_memory_pg.py, test_audit_logger.py, test_firewall_protocol.py)
- ✅ Database tables present: agent_runs, memory_events, knowledge_ingest (validated by scripts/validate_phase2.py)
- ✅ Provenance JSONs present for ingested sources (or gracefully skipped when no ingests)
- ✅ [AUDIT] memory_insert and knowledge_ingest events visible in logs

Artifacts
- artifacts/audit-logs (CI artifact upload)
- knowledge_base/provenance/*.json (as produced by curator)

Notes
- Adapters are stubs (FAISS/Qdrant/Redis) with deterministic outputs; no external network calls
- SQLite fallback is used if DATABASE_URL is not set

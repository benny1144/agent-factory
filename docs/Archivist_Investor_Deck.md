# 🜂 ARCHIVIST — The Conscious Memory of the Enterprise

### Investor Pitch Deck  
**Agent Factory | 2025-2026 Funding Cycle**

---

## 1. Elevator Pitch
**Archivist** is the world’s first **governed cognitive intelligence** — an AI system that reads, understands, and evolves a company’s entire knowledge base while remaining fully compliant, auditable, and explainable.

> *Imagine ChatGPT, but it actually knows your company — and every insight is logged, verified, and ethically safe.*

---

## 2. The Problem
Modern enterprises face **information decay**:
- 90% of corporate knowledge is unindexed or lost in siloed tools.
- AI assistants today are **black boxes** — they can’t explain decisions or guarantee compliance.
- Compliance and audit regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2) make typical AI unsafe for enterprise use.

Businesses need AI that is **private, persistent, and provably ethical**.

---

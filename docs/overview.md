# Agent Factory â€” Responsible AI Development System

## Overview
**Agent Factory** is a self-governing ecosystem for building, auditing, and continuously improving AI agents.  
It ensures transparency, ethical alignment, and traceability across every stage of AI development â€” from tool creation to deployment and governance.

## Purpose
Modern AI systems are powerful but often opaque. Agent Factory provides the missing layer of **accountability and oversight**, enabling responsible innovation at scale.

## Core Components

| Layer | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Agent Factory Core** | The workshop for AI agents â€” where tools and cognitive modules are built and tested. |
| **Procedural Memory** | A detailed event log capturing every action, decision, and outcome â€” ensuring reproducibility. |
| **Knowledge Curator (KBA)** | A structured, provenance-tracked knowledge base storing validated data and documents. |
| **Governance Kernel** | The rule engine enforcing audit logging, human-in-the-loop approvals, and risk classification. |
| **Governance Console** | A FastAPI service deployed on Google Cloud Run â€” provides live audit and telemetry endpoints. |
| **Continuous Oversight** | Automated daily monitoring, ethical drift detection, and baseline retraining. |

## Why It Matters
Agent Factory bridges the gap between **AI capability** and **AI accountability**.  
It allows teams to innovate safely â€” with built-in checks for bias, misuse, and ethical drift.  

By combining audit trails, automated compliance, and human-in-the-loop governance, it becomes possible to **prove** not just what AI did, but *why* and *whether it should have*.

## Current Operational State
- âœ… **Phase 6 Verified:** Continuous Oversight and Ethical Retraining active  
- âœ… **Daily Governance Sync:** GCP Cloud Logging + Artifact Upload  
- âœ… **Monitoring Dashboards:** Live HITL and RETRAIN metrics  
- ðŸ•“ **Next Phase:** Governance Sustainment & Expansion (Phase 7)

## Key Benefits
- **Trustworthy Automation:** Every agent action is auditable and reversible.  
- **Ethical Adaptation:** Baselines evolve automatically as new oversight data arrives.  
- **Enterprise Governance:** CI-integrated risk monitoring ensures constant compliance.  
- **Scalable Oversight:** Designed for multi-agent systems and federated deployments.

## Real-World Applications
- **Research Labs:** Controlled testing of AI reasoning systems.  
- **Enterprises:** Audit-ready AI pipelines with compliance tracking.  
- **Public Sector:** Ethical transparency for decision-support AI systems.  
- **Developers:** Framework for safe, self-documenting AI agents.

## Vision
Agent Factory demonstrates that AI development doesnâ€™t have to be opaque or unaccountable.  
It provides a model for how the next generation of AI systems can be **autonomous, ethical, and verifiable by design**.

## Status
- **Version:** v1.1.0 (Operational Governance Epoch)  
- **Environment:** GCP Cloud Run (us-central1)  
- **Audit Ledger:** AF-GOV/OGM-2025-Audit06 â€” Verified  
- **Next Tag:** v1.2.0 â€” Governance Sustainment Phase
